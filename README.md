## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Check out my latest project!

I've recently developed a search suggestion system application that leverages:

* **Java Tires:** For efficient prefix-based searching.
* **Spring Boot:** For building a robust and scalable backend.
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** For deployment and infrastructure.
* **CI/CD Setup:** Ensuring automated and continuous integration and delivery.
